# *Ad-hoc* mesh network working as a tracking system with the use of ESP32, Mosquitto broker and Paho MQTT client

This paper implements an indoor tracking technique based in the bidirectional measurement of the received signal strength (RSSI) of each node present in an ad-hoc mesh network composed by ESP32 microcontrollers, so the distance between each node with known position and the unknown node can be estimated and allowing to track the coordinates of the
latter device.
